      The explanation of the Pleistocene glaciations in terms of secular variations of the Earthâ€™s orbital elements, the Milankovitch theory, has recently gained considerable support. The South Australian ridge sequence was dated by polarity reversal, and concluded that it contains components related to the Earth orbital elements. Exept for the dominance of the 100,000-yr component and its phase relative to the eccentricity variations, the ridge evidence is consistent with the Milankovitch theory.
